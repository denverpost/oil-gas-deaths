		<p class="lead">Colorado oil and gas regulators receive dozens of reports about workplace accidents every year. But the regulators, lacking legislative authority, don&rsquo;t punish companies with repeated worker safety problems or share the reports with federal safety officials. And the majority of deaths in the industry go undocumented by the regulators, The Denver Post has found.</p>
		<p>That gap is just one example of a missed opportunity by state leaders to better understand occupational safety on oil and gas sites and to protect workers.</p>
		<p>In Colorado, there is no commission devoted solely to worker safety, no agency that warns lawmakers about trends in worker deaths and no researchers who cull data on all workplace injuries.</p>
		<p>The state, for instance, is one of only nine not participating in a federal survey that tracks when workers are hurt but not killed. The federal government provides a grant to pay for the state&rsquo;s collection of data on worker deaths. But the Colorado legislature must pay half the cost of participating in the nationwide Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses.</p>
		<p>And that hasn&rsquo;t happened.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s cost-prohibitive for Colorado to participate in that process,&rdquo; said Michael Van Dyke, a Colorado Health Department official who oversees the state&rsquo;s collection of reports on workplace deaths.</p>
		<p>Other states have been more proactive when it comes to monitoring worker safety, especially on oil and gas sites.</p>
		<p>Wyoming has a researcher who does nothing but track workplace deaths and who produces an annual report identifying trends and recommending changes.</p>
		<p>West Virginia formed a commission to study worker safety in the oil and gas industry. The commission&rsquo;s work led the state legislature to pass a bill this year that will create a database of accidents at oil and gas worksites.</p>
		<p>In Colorado, there already is a requirement that oil and gas companies report certain accidents to the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, the state agency that regulates the industry. But state law says the COGCC should administer rules only to protect the environment and the general public. The statute specifically forbids the COGCC from imposing worker safety rules on companies already regulated by the Occupational Health and Safety Administration.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I think we view our authority in this realm pretty narrowly,&rdquo; said Matt Lepore, the commission&rsquo;s director.</p>
		<p>Between 2000 and 2015, companies reported 485 accidents to the COGCC, using a document that the commission calls a Form 22. In 348 of those accidents, a worker was injured or killed, a Post review of the reports found.</p>
		<p>But the complicated wording of the rule that requires the reports gives companies wide discretion about when &mdash; and when not &mdash; to tell state regulators about an accident.</p>
		<p>COGCC Rule 602(b) says companies must report accidents that result in &ldquo;injury to a member of the general public which requires Medical Treatment [sic]&rdquo; or that cause &ldquo;significant damage&rdquo; to equipment. Additional wording in the rule narrows the requirement even further. The only accidents that need to be reported are those &ldquo;involving a fire, explosion, detonation, or release of pressure.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Lepore said most companies err on the side of overreporting, something the COGCC encourages.</p>
		<p>The Post, in reviewing the reports, found instances when companies told the COGCC about workers who suffered bee stings, split lips, twisted ankles or pinched fingers that needed stitches &mdash; all things they were not technically obligated to report.</p>
		<p>But the limited nature of the rule also gives companies latitude not to report serious accidents or deaths.</p>
		<p>Searching through government documents and news reports, The Post found records on 44 workplace deaths connected to the oil and gas industry in Colorado since 2000. The federal Bureau of Labor Statistics says there have been even more &mdash; reporting 51 deaths in Colorado&rsquo;s oil and gas industry between 2003 and 2014.</p>
		<p>The COGCC, though, has received Form 22s for only 18 deaths since 2000.</p>
		<p>The large majority of unreported deaths &mdash; as well as a number of the reported deaths &mdash; were the result of accidents that companies were not officially required to tell the COGCC about. But there were also two deaths involving releases of pressure, one each in 2000 and 2014, for which no Form 22 could be found.</p>
		<p>Lepore said he was aware of the 2014 death, which involved a Halliburton employee named Matt Smith who was working on a site owned by Anadarko Petroleum. When told no report about Smith&rsquo;s death could be found, Lepore expressed confusion.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I know about that incident, and, if there&rsquo;s not a Form 22, I am a little bit surprised,&rdquo; he said.</p>
		<p>A subsequent check by COGCC staff failed to turn up the report. An Anadarko representative said the report was Halliburton&rsquo;s responsibility, and a Halliburton spokeswoman said it was Anadarko&rsquo;s.</p>
		<p>A spokesman for the commission later wrote in an e-mail that companies sometimes notify the COGCC of deaths through phone calls but don&rsquo;t file a Form 22. He said the commission&rsquo;s staff &ldquo;cannot readily recall a case involving a fatality where COGCC was not notified in some way.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;From our experience, it&rsquo;s true, at times, that filing a form with an agency that doesn&rsquo;t regulate workplace safety has been lost in the trauma of the event,&rdquo; spokesman Todd Hartman wrote in the e-mail.</p>
		<p>COGCC rules allow the commission to punish an oil and gas company with a fine of up to $10,000 a day for not filing an accident report, but Lepore said the commission would typically just ask the company to correct the lapse by filing a new report. Hartman said the commission&rsquo;s staff is currently developing clearer guidance for when a Form 22 is required.</p>
		<p>Even when regulators receive a Form 22, their focus isn&rsquo;t on worker safety.</p>
		<p>In 2012, for instance, an explosion at a well in Weld County killed Brian Wallace, a subcontractor at the well site. When the site&rsquo;s operator, Encana, reported the explosion &mdash; and the subsequent release of natural gas &mdash; to the COGCC, it referenced Wallace&rsquo;s death tersely.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;The incident resulted in one contractor fatality, and three other injuries,&rdquo; the company wrote.</p>
		<p>A COGCC manager didn&rsquo;t ask for more details.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;No further action is required for reporting on the accident portion,&rdquo; the manager wrote to Encana in an e-mail. &ldquo;The COGCC environmental group will be in contact if additional information is needed on the release.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Lepore said the COGCC collects Form 22s as a way to monitor emerging environmental safety hazards at oil and gas sites. For instance, he mentioned a rash of fires at oil-collection tanks in 2014 that COGCC staffers first noticed in Form 22s. The COGCC asked one company to do a deeper search for the cause.</p>
		<p>The answer, though, may have provided a clue to a problem federal occupational safety researchers, too, were wrestling with.</p>
		<p>In 2014, three workers died of heart failure in Colorado after breathing in toxic fumes while taking samples from the same type of collection tanks, a process known as &ldquo;tank gauging.&rdquo; The COGCC, in fact, had received a Form 22 for one of those deaths, as well as another Form 22 for an instance when a worker &ldquo;lost and regained consciousness&rdquo; while tank gauging.</p>
		<p>Lepore said one possible explanation for the fires was the linking up of multiple collection tanks, something that has become more common as companies use new technology to drill several wells from the same pad. The linking allows large concentrations of fumes from the whole series of tanks to escape from a single leakage point &mdash; or a single sampling hatch.</p>
		<p>COGCC staffers have considered proposing a rule requiring there to be valves between the tanks to prevent the buildup of fumes, Lepore said. But, because of the COGCC&rsquo;s limitations when it comes to worker safety, the change would be intended to address only the fires, not the deaths.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not our role,&rdquo; he said.</p>
		<p>Instead, Lepore said, it&rsquo;s OSHA&rsquo;s.</p>
		<p>But, as with all industries, oil and gas companies are required to call OSHA after a small percentage of only the most serious accidents that occur on worksites. A new rule will require companies with more than 250 employees to submit data on all accidents to OSHA four times a year. Smaller companies in some industries &mdash; but not the oil and gas industry &mdash; will also have to submit the data.</p>
		<p>That makes the COGCC&rsquo;s Form 22s a potentially valuable source of information on accidents at oil and gas sites. But Lepore said he knows of no instance when the COGCC shared information or trends from the accident reports with OSHA. Herb Gibson, OSHA&rsquo;s area director in Denver, said he can&rsquo;t recall any time when the COGCC notified his agency of safety problems.</p>
		<p>Other states, when faced with deaths in the oil and gas industry, have decided it&rsquo;s not enough to leave worker safety solely up to OSHA.</p>
		<p>In Wyoming, where the Bureau of Labor Statistics says 69 oil and gas workers died between 2003 and 2014, officials in 2011 created a position for a state occupational epidemiologist &mdash; a researcher who would examine trends in oil and gas deaths and recommend changes that could prevent them. The epidemiologist now produces a report every year that goes to lawmakers and state officials.</p>
		<p>Meredith Towle, the current epidemiologist, said she has changed the way some deaths are categorized &mdash; for example, putting the deaths of workers driving between wells into the oil and gas classification instead of the transportation classification &mdash; to get employers to pay more attention to the industry&rsquo;s hazards.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We just wanted the oil and gas industry to get a better picture of what is causing fatalities among the workers supporting the industry,&rdquo; she said.</p>
		<p>In West Virginia, where 26 oil and gas workers died between 2003 and 2014, Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin was so alarmed at the accidents &mdash; and the fact that he learned about many of them only through the media &mdash; that he has created a special commission on oil and gas safety. The commission included state and local officials and representatives of the industry, held six meetings across the state in 2015 and, by the end, presented 18 recommendations on worker safety.</p>
		<p>Among the proposals: a comprehensive database of fatal and serious-injury accidents at oil and gas sites, a centralized list of classes on occupational safety, a set of best practices for monitoring toxic vapors at worksites, and a legal change that might encourage companies to investigate more deeply after an accident.</p>
		<p>The West Virginia legislature passed bills this year that adopted several of the recommendations, including a reporting requirement that will lead to the database&rsquo;s creation.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;These additional enhancements will make the operation of this entire industry a safer one for the workers,&rdquo; said Lawrence Malone, the chairman of the commission and Tomblin&rsquo;s policy director.</p>
		<p>That, said Peter Dooley, a safety advocate with the National Council for Occupational Safety and Health, is really the goal: incremental improvement. And, with the oil and gas industry, that improvement often comes first through just learning about every accident and injury. When worker safety lives in the shadows, he said, dangers thrive.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Ultimately,&rdquo; Dooley said, &ldquo;oil and gas is a very, very, very hazardous industry.&rdquo;</p>

				<h3 class="subheading">Risks in patch didn&rsquo;t dissuade old-school roughneck</h3>
				<p class="blurb">Once a burly, rugged worker, Randy Hall withered away in his final days</p>
				<p class="byline">By Monte Whaley, The Denver Post</p>
				<p>MEAD &mdash; Under a slate-gray sky, Randy Hall&rsquo;s friends and family trudged into the candle-lit Highland Lake Community Church to mourn the man revered as one of the last true roughnecks.</p>
				<p>The church&rsquo;s old, wooden floors creaked under the weight of cowboy and work boots as mourners slid into pews, filling the 120-year-old building with memories and tears.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;He played so hard. He worked so hard,&rdquo; Dustin Turner, one of Hall&rsquo;s sons, said late in the afternoon of May 4, 2015. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe he went the way he did.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Turner wasn&rsquo;t surprised at the robust turnout to honor his dad. Many who came had worked with Randy Hall in the past two decades in the Colorado oil fields.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that brotherhood you kind of build up,&rdquo; said Turner, 30. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s life in the oil patch. It always has been, and it always will be.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Turner&rsquo;s burly and rambunctious dad, who largely ignored life&rsquo;s restraints, wasted away in a hospital bed in 2015, gasping for air after years working just about every job in the oil fields. An autopsy said Randy Hall suffered from lung disease and pulmonary hypertension.</p>
				<p>His family says it all came about after Randy was engulfed in a vapor cloud, probably sulfuric acid, in February 2014 while working for the K.P. Kauffman Company on an Anadarko-owned oil rig in Weld County.</p>
				<p>Randy&rsquo;s family blames Kauffman for his death, even though the family&rsquo;s lawyer says there is no provable link between Hall&rsquo;s death and his work on the patch, at least not enough to put before a jury.</p>
				<p>A May 2015 autopsy by Weld County Coroner James Wilkerson said Hall, who died at 53, suffered from pulmonary hypertension and had a history of methamphetamine use, which he used regularly until about eight months before his death. The autopsy said that in February 2014, Hall &ldquo;had a huge exposure to sulfuric acid.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>He had collapsed, lapsed into unconsciousness and had respiratory distress, the report said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;He went to the emergency room and was given some medicines and sent home. He was laid off from his job and got other jobs in the oil fields but was unable to keep up,&rdquo; the autopsy report said. &ldquo;Tests showed interstitial lung disease.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Kauffman officials have not responded to messages asking for comment.</p>
				<p>Becky Hall concedes oil-field work is what her husband wanted to do with his life, even with its inherent risks.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;He knew how dangerous it was,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It just wasn&rsquo;t like him to quit on a job, and let other people down.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Oil and gas workers face one of the most lethal work environments in the country.</p>
				<p>Between 2003 and 2014, 1,333 U.S. oil and gas workers were killed on the job. Over the past five years, reported fatality rates in oil and gas extraction work were five to seven times the national fatality rate among all workers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>
				<p>Traumatic injuries are the most common cause of death in the industry, usually being hit by tools or equipment, according to federal data.</p>
				<p>Workers have been killed from falls, electrocution, burns and scaldings. Acute chemical inhalation can also kill workers, and many think those deaths are undercounted.</p>
				<p>Still, workers keep flocking to the industry. Money is the prime draw.</p>
				<p>A 2014 study by the University of Colorado Leeds School of Business measured the fiscal contribution of oil and gas from 2008 to 2012. It found that in 2012, the industry paid nearly $3.23 billion to workers across Colorado, or 2.4 percent of total Colorado salary and wages, and supported an additional $3.5 billion in wages to other industries..</p>
				<p>Also in 2012, the average wage paid in oil and gas work was $101,341, compared with an average wage of $50,338 in all other industries in the state, or 101 percent higher.</p>
				<p>Even workers who have not finished high school can pull in $15.29 an hour as a laborer and $19.27 as a roustabout, according to a 2012 report from the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment.</p>
				<p>The jobs are often migratory. Workers can be in Weld County one week and North Dakota or Wyoming the next week.</p>
				<p>Besides big paychecks, many say there is a military-like camaraderie among workers. It draws people in, even those well into their 50s.</p>
				<p>Randy and Becky got married in 1983, right after she graduated from high school. He was 21 and she was 18.</p>
				<p>He worked on and off in construction in his home state of South Dakota. When he heard the oil business was booming in Colorado, they moved to Mead in 1994.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;There were lots of jobs,&rdquo; Becky recalled, &ldquo;and plenty of people were hiring.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Randy got certified as a welder and worked just about every job in the patch.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;He loved it,&rdquo; she said.</p>
				<p>She knew he was seriously ill when he came home from a day of work in February 2014 and coughed so hard he broke a rib. He found it tougher to work, and Becky said he was later fired over the telephone for missing work. Hall endured several stays in hospitals until he died on April 10, 2015.</p>
				<p>During his funeral service, everyone talked of Hall&rsquo;s toughness and loyalty. Later, mourners walked quietly to a park near the shore of Highland Lake for a fried chicken dinner and to reminisce.</p>
				<p>A few gathered around Turner as he fired a homemade cannon to shoot his father&rsquo;s ashes over the lake.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;He loved it here,&rdquo; Turner said. &ldquo;I figured it was the best place for him.&rdquo;</p>
