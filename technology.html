		<p class="lead">Death came to Jim Freemyer through a toxic plume of volatile gas escaping so fast it knocked him out and left him lying face-down over an open tank hatch on an oil rig in remote Weld County. The gas that hit Freemyer in July 2014 <a target="_blank" href="https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=NEWS_RELEASES&p_id=29571">was a deadly mix of unstable hydrocarbons</a> &mdash; including benzene, butane and propane &mdash; that robbed the 59-year-old truck driver of oxygen and disrupted his already diseased heart.</p>
		<p>A coroner found that the respirator Freemyer was using on the day he died &mdash; a $30 unit his employer would not even pay for, according to his family&rsquo; s attorney &mdash; was not fit-tested to ensure it covered his face properly. Freemyer probably&nbsp;would have survived had he been given a more expensive oxygen unit that supplied him with fresh air, much like what firefighters use when they enter a toxic, smoke-filled environment, Weld County medical examiner Dr. James Wilkerson said.</p>
		<p>Yet the federal government does not require the use of any type of respirator by workers when they measure the oil in tanks for volume and water content. The practice of &ldquo;tank gauging&rdquo; is primitive in an era of satellite imagery and cellphones. It usually involves a truck driver, like Freemyer, dropping a glass vial and tape measure through an oil tank&rsquo;s &ldquo;thief hatch.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Vapors amass just above the liquids in the storage tanks and often are released with such force that they can blow off a worker&rsquo;s helmet.</p>
		<p>Another potentially life-saving technology &mdash; remote sensors in tanks that eliminate the need for manual measurements &mdash; also is optional for operators. Industry groups have argued that remote sensors are prohibitively expensive for many companies and that requirements for the technology would place &ldquo;unnecessary costs on oil and gas development.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>These safety gaps frustrate industry watchers who say neither the government nor employers go far enough to protect oil and gas workers.</p>
		<p>Besides problems with tank gauging, critics also say the oil and gas industry still relies on aging rigs instead of new, safer ones when drillers scramble to increase production in boom times.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;The industry can be slow to adopting technology,&rdquo; said Karen Boman, senior editor for the online magazine Rigzone and a veteran of covering the industry. &ldquo;Some companies have an attitude of ‘If it&rsquo;s not broken, don&rsquo;t fix it,&rsquo; or ‘If nothing bad has happened, there&rsquo;s no reason to change what we are doing.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>

		<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.coshnetwork.org/staff">Peter Dooley</a>, safety and health project consultant for the National Council for Occupational Safety and Health, said safety recommendations often go unheeded.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;You can have all the voluntary industrywide safety days you want,&rdquo; Dooley said. &ldquo;But if there is not a requirement to do something, that often puts safety on the back burner.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Oil and gas proponents concede 2014 <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ishn.com/articles/98283-serious-injuries-and-fatalities-haunt-the-oil-and-gas-industry">was one of the worst years ever for deaths in the industry</a> &mdash; at least 144 oil and gas workers died across the nation, a 29 percent jump from 2013, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. But they still point to an overall improving safety record, which they attribute to a constant focus on bettering processes and training employees. And they say the industry&rsquo;s brawling, hard-living days of roughnecking are long gone.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Most of what we do these days requires good, capable computer skills,&rdquo; said Dale Robinson, an Occupational Safety and Health Administration-approved instructor who helps prepare employees for safety certification in the oil patch. &ldquo;We really don&rsquo;t have time for that type of nonsense that we had in the past.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The industry says it has spent $7 billion in new technology since 2003 to enhance exploration, production and safety. New tools such as optical-gas-imaging cameras, premium-efficiency flameproof motors and virtual-reality oil-rig training are clear signs the industry is becoming safer and more efficient, industry officials say.</p>
		<p>Stephen Flaherty, director of state and local government affairs for Halliburton, says his company has seen &ldquo;<a target="_blank" href="http://sntr.senate.ca.gov/sites/sntr.senate.ca.gov/files/6%2018%20Halliburton%20letter.PDF">double-digit decreases in accidents and injuries</a> because of our safety practices.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>But in Freemyer&rsquo;s case, the industry failed to provide him the basic technology to survive a day of work.</p>
		<p>In his case, OSHA, which oversees worker safety in the oil and gas industry, fined his employer, Now or Never Trucking of Greeley, $19,500 for violations that included providing inadequate protection from petroleum fumes. The amount was negotiated to $12,500 in a settlement.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I think a lot of operators out there are not held accountable for some of the actions like my dad&rsquo;s death,&rdquo; said Freemyer&rsquo;s son, Mike. &ldquo;They believe their process is sufficient, but until they get enough people dying under their watch, or unless someone forces them to, they are not going to invest in the type of technology that prevents these deaths.&rdquo;</p>

		<p class="lead">The rising toll of tank gauging has rekindled the debate over investments in safety technology. Freemyer was among 10 oil and gas industry workers, including two others in Colorado, who died of hydrocarbon poisoning since 2010, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.osha.gov/Publications/OSHA3843.pdf">new research by&nbsp;the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has found</a>. Only Freemyer was wearing a respirator. Researchers suspect such poisoning caused many more deaths that have been attributed to other causes.</p>
		<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.jacksonlewis.com/publication/judge-s-ruling-oil-and-gas-worker-s-death-could-spark-change">Freemyer&rsquo;s death</a> was not the first involving tank gauging for Now or Never Trucking. Just four months earlier, Now or Never employee Joe Ray Sherman lost consciousness while pulling an oil sample out of a tank in a site near Kersey, and he <a target="_blank" href="http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/17/toxic-vapors-suspected-in-deaths-of-three-colorado-oil-and-gas-workers/">fell to his death</a>.</p>
		<p>Now or Never was fined $5,775 for Sherman&rsquo;s death. The coroner determined Sherman died of heart disease, although the CDC later linked his death to tank gauging.</p>
		<p>Both the industry and government officials have issued warnings about tank gauging and emphasize safe practices, including wearing &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; respiratory protection and working upwind and at safe distances from open hatches. But those are just recommendations.</p>
		<p>OSHA works with the oil and gas industry to encourage programs that limit hazards, which are more effective in the long run, officials say.</p>
		<p>The agency does not require respirators for tank gauging, but companies can be penalized if workers are likely to be exposed to high levels of volatile organic carbon during the task, said Herb Gibson, OSHA&rsquo;s regional director.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;If we have evidence there is an atmosphere that is dangerous to life or health, we require a proper respirator,&rdquo; Gibson said.</p>
		<p>Another safety measure is using automated tank gauging technology, which includes taking oil measurements from a remote location and away from potential hazards.</p>
		<p>But the use of automated tank gauging is mixed among the industry. Tanks mainly are monitored and gauged manually by workers like Freemyer.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;In an era of rising economic challenges and increasingly important domestic security, BLM should not add unnecessary costs on oil and gas development,&rdquo; the American Petroleum Institute, Independent Petroleum Association of America and Western Energy Alliance said in testimony against the new BLM rule.</p>
		<p><a target="_blank" href="https://oem.ucsf.edu/faculty/faculty.html?key=ed038116f2d49334af7f9be1a5c2354a&name=HARRISON%2CROBERT+J">Dr. Robert Harrison</a>, a clinical professor at the University of California at San Francisco who studies occupational and environmental medicine, led the CDC&rsquo;s investigation into what was killing oil-field workers over the past five years while taking oil samples or gauging oil tanks. Harrison says it&rsquo;s time for industry to step up.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Maybe the use of remote tank gauging is seen by the industry as not that cost-efficient,&rdquo; Harrison said. &ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s cheaper to pay a high school graduate $60,000 a year and give him some training and put him up in North Dakota than put in technology on an oil tank.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We need to be looking at the health issues as well as the most effective protocols to protect the people who work the oil fields in this country,&rdquo; Harrison said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to have to wait and start counting the bodies.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Industry officials say the cost of automatic tank gauging is often prohibitive, especially for smaller companies. Installing off-site gauging equipment could cost about $2,000 per tank, said Kathleen Sgamma, vice president of government and public affairs for Western Energy Alliance.</p>
		<p>But the system infrastructure &mdash; which includes wiring, cables, monitors and probes to capture the data accurately —&nbsp;could drive the cost of switching to an automated system to $50,000 to $60,000 per tank, Sgamma said.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It could easily put a producer out of business,&rdquo; she said.</p>
		<p>The industry&rsquo;s opposition to automatic tank gauging is &ldquo;insane,&rdquo; said Gary Wilson, general manager of TankLogix of Odessa, Texas.</p>
		<p>Wilson&rsquo;s company makes automatic oil measurement equipment, and he says the push to make such equipment uniform across the oil industry has been maddening.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just painful to get any kind of movement on this, and we have been beating this to death for years,&rdquo; Wilson said. &ldquo;If they all went to tank level sensors, it would eliminate truck drivers having to do this and a whole lot of deaths.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Wilson would not provide a cost breakdown of TankLogix&rsquo;s equipment.</p>
		<p>A BLM report estimates it would cost the oil and gas industry &ldquo;about $558,000 annually&rdquo; to allow the new form of tank gauging on federal land, a figure the industry claims is way too low.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;These costs include expenses associated with upgrading or replacing equipment, increased sampling and inspection, restrapping thousands of tanks, modifying thousands of tanks to make them vapor-tight and developing safety protocols for gauging now-vapor-filled tanks,&rdquo;&nbsp;according to an industry analysis.</p>
		<p>Officials concede remote sensors can be costly, especially to smaller companies, and complicated to install, said Eric Esswein, senior industrial hygienist with the CDC and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Engineering controls can be very expensive to purchase, install, operate and maintain, but they are first in the hierarchy of controls for a very good reason,&rdquo; Esswein said. &ldquo;They can limit or even eliminate exposures.&rdquo;</p>
		<hr>
		<p class="lead">Freemyer&rsquo;s case shows the changing perception of the dangers of tank gauging. His bosses claimed he&nbsp;died because of his health. He suffered from poorly controlled Type II diabetes, high blood pressure and &ldquo;dangerously elevated&rdquo; triglycerides.</p>
		<p>The autopsy also found a 90 percent blockage in his right coronary artery and blamed his death on his health problems.</p>
		<p>Those health woes were considered culprits in an incident three weeks before his death. He was found by a co-worker with his gas monitor beeping, leaning over a hatch with his hands empty, but looking like he was trying to reel in his gauge.</p>
		<p>Now or Never&rsquo;s operations manager, Lee Mulkey, took Freemyer to a hospital &mdash; and he was cleared to work the next day. Mulkey later testified in a court hearing that he figured Freemyer became disoriented because of a diabetic episode and that he should have eaten something.</p>
		<p>But Freemyer&rsquo;s family refused to believe his health was at fault for his death &mdash; a finding that disqualified them from receiving workers&rsquo; compensation &mdash; and took Now or Never and its insurer to administrative court at a cost of $25,000.</p>
		<p>Wilkerson, who performed the original autopsy, later re-examined Freemyer&rsquo;s gas monitoring data and toxicology results and amended his findings.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;At first, I didn&rsquo;t understand what the data meant,&rdquo; Wilkerson said.</p>
		<p>He later concluded Freemyer died from a combination of toxic fumes and low oxygen.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;The device he was wearing indicated he was in a low-oxygen environment,&rdquo; Wilkerson said. &ldquo;That, coupled with hydrocarbon gases, all made sure he wouldn&rsquo;t survive what he was doing.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>After a lengthy fight, a Colorado administrative court judge <a target="_blank" href="http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/28/colorado-judge-awards-benefits-from-weld-county-oil-patch-death/">ruled last year that Freemyer&rsquo;s widow would get $530 per week for life</a>. The judge agreed with medical experts that her husband breathed in a toxic cloud of hydrocarbon vapors that killed him.</p>
		<p>In his July 2015 ruling, Judge Peter Cannici said Freemyer&rsquo;s job duties and work environment &ldquo;aggravated, accelerated or combined with his pre-existing coronary artery disease to cause his death.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Brett Busch, Freemyer&rsquo;s lawyer, is convinced the ruling will alter attitudes among oil companies.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;This case will be forcing a lot of oil companies to change what they have been doing as far safeguarding their employees,&rdquo; Busch said. &rdquo;Really, about the only thing they told my client to do was to stand upwind.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>The deaths of Freemyer and the nine others taught Wilkerson &mdash; the Larimer County coroner and a forensic pathologist for Weld and at least 20 other counties in Colorado and Wyoming &mdash; that death investigators could no longer ignore the role of hydrocarbons as culprits in oil worker deaths.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I think we all (coroners) will look at these things differently,&rdquo; Wilkerson said.</p>
		<hr>
		<p>Harrison began his investigation into tank gauging deaths when he learned of a 21-year-old worker&rsquo;s death in the North Dakota Bakken oil field in January 2012.</p>
		<p>Dustin Bergsing&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://billingsgazette.com/news/state-and-regional/montana/settlement-ends-lawsuit-over-montanan-s-oil-field-death/article_f6ea2116-9eda-5bda-a5e5-ce171a76622f.html">was found slumped on a catwalk</a> on top of a 20-foot-tall crude oil tank. His job was to open a hatch and drop a rope inside the tank to measure the level of oil.</p>
		<p>Bergsing&rsquo;s death was originally waved off as a result of inhaling hydrogen sulfide, long known as an oil-field killer. The so-called &ldquo;<a target="_blank" href="http://lubbockonline.com/local-news/2010-09-15/denver-city-remembers-h2s-tragedy#.V-l31YgrLGg">sour gas</a>,&rdquo; which is poisonous and pungent, took the lives of nine people in Denver City, Texas, in 1975 when an experimental gas injection well pipe connection ruptured.</p>
		<p>But UCSF&rsquo;s Harrison suspected something else, especially after an autopsy revealed Bergsing didn&rsquo;t have hydrogen sulfide in his blood system, but rather a combination of hydrocarbon gases, including benzene, ethane and butane.</p>
		<p>A cloud of those gases, released from a highly compressed gas pipe, can quickly displace oxygen and kill anyone leaning into the gas plume, Harrison said.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;After being exposed to something like this,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you really don&rsquo;t have much of a chance.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>At first, victims get short of breath, then they become dizzy and disoriented, said Dr. Michael Kosnett, a Denver-based consultant in occupational and environmental toxicology. Kosnett, also a member of the University of Colorado medical school&rsquo;s clinical faculty, was part of the team that probed the tank-gauging deaths and testified for Busch in the Freemyer case.</p>
		<p>Some of the victims had pre-existing conditions, such as bad hearts and diabetes, that put them at greater risk once they became exposed to the hydrocarbons, Kosnett said.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the perfect storm for sudden death,&rdquo; he said.</p>
		<p>Harrison&rsquo;s suspicions kicked off an investigation by NIOSH, an arm of the CDC. They, along with doctors and investigators with OSHA, reviewed databases, case files and media reports.</p>
		<p>Their findings were produced last year, complete with a profile of who and how the victims died, along with an industrywide warning about tank fluid collection and tank gauging.</p>
		<p>After that, OSHA and NIOSH <a target="_blank" href="http://ehstoday.com/osha/osha-and-niosh-issue-new-hazard-alert-dangers-tank-gauging">issued 10 recommendations</a> to the oil and gas industry for manual tank gauging and fluid sample collection. Those recommendations include ensuring that workers are trained on &mdash; and correctly and consistently use &mdash; calibrated multigas and oxygen monitors.</p>
		<p>Critics say the industry has known for years about the perils of tank gauging and refused to provide workers with adequate equipment and technology to deal with the dangers.</p>
		<p>Bergsing&rsquo;s mother filed a wrongful-death suit after he&nbsp;died. Her lawyers said Marathon Oil &ldquo;knew or should have known that the oil well and tank facility where he worked was unreasonably dangerous due to the presence of a large amount of toxic hydrocarbon gases under pressure in the oil.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The lawyers also said in a pretrial statement that Marathon Oil &ldquo;was actually warned by an employee that the accumulation of gases at these wells was ultrahazardous and could result in a death.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The lawsuit was later settled. Terms were not disclosed.</p>

				<h3 class="subheading">Old-school roughneck embraced dangerous work</h3>
				<p class="blurb">Once a burly, rugged worker, Randy Hall withered away in his final days</p>
				<p class="byline">By Monte Whaley, The Denver Post</p>
				<p>MEAD &mdash; Under a slate-gray sky, Randy Hall&rsquo;s friends and family trudged into the candle-lit Highland Lake Community Church to mourn the man revered as one of the last true roughnecks.</p>
				<p>The church&rsquo;s old, wooden floors creaked under the weight of cowboy and work boots as mourners slid into pews, filling the 120-year-old building with memories and tears.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;He played so hard. He worked so hard,&rdquo; Dustin Turner, one of Hall&rsquo;s sons, said late in the afternoon of May 4, 2015. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe he went the way he did.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Turner wasn&rsquo;t surprised at the robust turnout to honor his dad. Many who came had worked with Randy Hall in the past two decades in the Colorado oil fields.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that brotherhood you kind of build up,&rdquo; said Turner, 30. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s life in the oil patch. It always has been, and it always will be.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Turner&rsquo;s burly and rambunctious dad, who largely ignored life&rsquo;s restraints, wasted away in a hospital bed in 2015, gasping for air after years working just about every job in the oil fields. An autopsy said Randy Hall suffered from lung disease and pulmonary hypertension.</p>
				<p>His family says it all came about after Randy was engulfed in a vapor cloud, probably sulfuric acid, in February 2014 while working for the K.P. Kauffman Company on an Anadarko-owned oil rig in Weld County.</p>
				<p>Randy&rsquo;s family blames Kauffman for his death, even though the family&rsquo;s lawyer says there is no provable link between Hall&rsquo;s death and his work on the patch, at least not enough to put before a jury.</p>
				<p>A May 2015 autopsy by Weld County Coroner Dr. James Wilkerson said Hall, who died at 53, suffered from pulmonary hypertension and had a history of methamphetamine use, which he used regularly until about eight months before his death. The autopsy said that in February 2014, Hall &ldquo;had a huge exposure to sulfuric acid.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>He had collapsed, lapsed into unconsciousness and had respiratory distress, the report said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;He went to the emergency room and was given some medicines and sent home. He was laid off from his job and got other jobs in the oil fields but was unable to keep up,&rdquo; the autopsy report said. &ldquo;Tests showed interstitial lung disease.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Kauffman officials did not respond to messages asking for comment.</p>
				<p>Becky Hall concedes oil-field work is what her husband wanted to do with his life, even with its inherent risks.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;He knew how dangerous it was,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It just wasn&rsquo;t like him to quit on a job, and let other people down.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Oil and gas workers face one of the most lethal work environments in the country.</p>
				<p>Between 2003 and 2014, 1,333 U.S. oil and gas workers were killed on the job. In the five most recent years of data, fatality rates in oil and gas extraction work were five to seven times the national fatality rate among all workers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In that time span, the fatality rate in the construction industry was 2.8 times the rate for all workers, on average. Mining had a fatality rate 5.1 times the rate for all workers.</p>
				<p>Traumatic injuries are the most common cause of death in the industry, usually as a result of being hit by tools or equipment, according to federal data.</p>
				<p>Workers have been killed from falls, electrocution, burns and scaldings. Acute chemical inhalation can also kill workers, and many think those deaths are undercounted.</p>
				<p>Still, workers keep flocking to the industry. Money is the prime draw.</p>
				<p>A 2014 study by the University of Colorado Leeds School of Business measured the fiscal contribution of oil and gas from 2008 to 2012. It found that in 2012, the industry paid nearly $3.23 billion to workers across Colorado, or 2.4 percent of total Colorado salary and wages, and supported an additional $3.5 billion in wages to other industries..</p>
				<p>Also in 2012, the average wage paid in oil and gas work was $101,341, compared with an average wage of $50,338 in all other industries in the state, or 101 percent higher.</p>
				<p>Even workers who have not finished high school can pull in $15.29 an hour as a laborer and $19.27 as a roustabout, according to a 2012 report from the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment.</p>
				<p>The jobs are often migratory. Workers can be in Weld County one week and North Dakota or Wyoming the next week.</p>
				<p>Besides big paychecks, many say there is a military-like camaraderie among workers. It draws people in, even those well into their 50s.</p>
				<p>Randy and Becky got married in 1983, right after she graduated from high school. He was 21 and she was 18.</p>
				<p>He worked on and off in construction in his home state of South Dakota. When he heard the oil business was booming in Colorado, they moved to Mead in 1994.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;There were lots of jobs,&rdquo; Becky recalled, &ldquo;and plenty of people were hiring.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Randy got certified as a welder and worked just about every job in the patch.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;He loved it,&rdquo; she said.</p>
				<p>She knew he was seriously ill when he came home from a day of work in February 2014 and coughed so hard he broke a rib. He found it tougher to work, and Becky said he was later fired over the telephone for missing work. Hall endured several stays in hospitals until he died on April 10, 2015.</p>
				<p>During his funeral service, everyone talked of Hall&rsquo;s toughness and loyalty. Later, mourners walked quietly to a park near the shore of Highland Lake for a fried chicken dinner and to reminisce.</p>
				<p>A few gathered around Turner as he fired a homemade cannon to shoot his father&rsquo;s ashes over the lake.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;He loved it here,&rdquo; Turner said. &ldquo;I figured it was the best place for him.&rdquo;</p>

		<p class="lead">Oil companies and their allies bristle when asked whether they downplay safety protocols and procedures.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Nobody wants to be the one who has to show up and tell a parent that their son or daughter has been killed on a job site,&rdquo; said Carrie Jordan, president of MJS Safety, which holds regular safety-certification programs for oil and gas companies in Colorado.</p>
		<p>Jordan also heads the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.djbsafety.org/">DJ Basin Safety Council</a>, a consortium of oil and gas companies that meets monthly to discuss safety issues and plan strategies to reduce the number of deaths and injuries on oil sites.</p>
		<p>Safety classes for oil-field workers in Colorado are mandatory to keep them up to date on the latest technology and safety updates, Jordan said. Workers need to keep their certifications current if they want to work, Jordan said.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Most oil sites won&rsquo;t even let you near equipment unless you have been certified,&rdquo; she said.</p>
		<p>Many local community colleges have oil and gas safety curricula and host refresher courses.</p>
		<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rmecosha.com/">Rocky Mountain Education Center</a> at Red Rocks Community College is an OSHA-approved training and safety clearinghouse that holds classes for oil workers from Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota.</p>
		<p>Many of the students run counter to the stereotype of the hard-drinking, hard-living, no-holds-barred oil roughneck, said Joan Smith, executive director of the center.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Oil companies are constantly using new technologies to improve production and to ensure safety,&rdquo; Smith said. &ldquo;Most of the workers have to know how to use a laptop. They are a lot more technologically savvy than in the past.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Since 2003, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6420a4.htm ">oil and gas deaths nationwide have trended higher</a>, but industry advocates say those totals mask some improvements. There were 85 deaths in 2003 and it dropped below that number only once in the next 11 years (68 in 2009), with a high of 144 in 2014, according to the BLS figures.<p>
		<p>Fatal injuries specifically due to being hit by equipment on oil sites fell 61 percent from 2003 to 2013 while transportation fatalities &mdash; the most common area of oil-field deaths &mdash; dropped by 28 percent, according to NIOSH. In that same period, as oil and gas employment boomed, fatality rates fell 58 percent for operators &mdash; the companies that actually own the well sites &mdash; and 33 percent for well-servicing companies. A report expected later this year will show whether those declines continued in 2014.<p>
		<p>Because oil companies are doing a better job monitoring air quality around their tanks and investing in off-site tank gauging, there has not been an additional death due to tank gauging in Colorado since 2014, said OSHA&rsquo;s Gibson.</p>
		<p>But near-deaths and injuries due to tank gauging are probably&nbsp;not being reported, which skew statistics in favor of the industry, said Dooley, whose group is union-affiliated and advocates for worker health and safety.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I think injury reporting is very, very unreliable in this industry,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There are incentives not to report and disincentives to report. That&rsquo;s a huge problem in oil and gas.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>A simple slowdown in drilling can also play a role in fewer reported deaths and injuries, he said.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;The numbers thing can be really, really deceiving,&rdquo; he said.</p>

		<p>Oil companies say they have improved safety procedures and standards over the past decade, mostly by investing in new technologies and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ishn.com/articles/96860-oil-gas-industry-to-observe-safety-stand-down-nov-14">holding nationwide safety &ldquo;stand-downs</a>.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>One such event, in November 2014, involved the CDC, OSHA and the National Service, Transmission, Exploration and Production Safety Network. The kickoff event in Humble, Texas, included industry roundtables and a case-study presentation.</p>
		<p>OSHA also asked employers to set aside time after the event to share safety information throughout their workforce.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;That effort in itself has helped the industry become safer way more so than any citation or new regulations they can write,&rdquo; said Joe Hurt, vice president of the International Association of Drilling Contractors.</p>
		<p>A similar push was launched last year on the subject of tank gauging.</p>
		<p>Still, more work needs to be done to cut oil-field accidents and deaths, said Kyla Retzer, who heads the Colorado office of NIOSH.</p>
		<p>Retzer is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/13/feds-in-colorado-launch-huge-oil-and-gas-worker-safety-study/">leading a new study of oil field-related hazards</a> in three high-producing states. She hopes that will result in a safer work environment for workers.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;The industry wants to keep things safer for their workers, and, of course, we do as well,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Everybody is going toward the same goal.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Mike Freemyer said his dad probably trusted his employer too much.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I think he would trust the people in charge to make that assessment about safety,&rdquo; he said.</p>
		<p>His dad worked the family farm west of Limon before he decided to get an associate&rsquo;s degree in cafeteria management, and then he moved into long-haul trucking. But Mike Freemyer&rsquo;s brother, who also worked in oil and gas, told his dad about the good paychecks in oil and gas, and that persuaded him to get a job in the oil patch. It seemed a good move at first.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t think he realized the danger he was in,&rdquo; Mike Freemyer said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he had any idea.&rdquo;</p>
