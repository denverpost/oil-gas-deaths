                            <p>Rens worked for a company servicing remote oil and gas wells, which required him to use a snowmobile in winter.

He swerved into the snowbank, which tossed him back onto the road, where he was run over and killed. His widow filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the company that owned the truck and the company that plowed the road. The suit was settled for undisclosed terms. In addition to his wife, Rens was survived by three daughters, according to his obituary. He was a Marine Corps veteran and Purple Heart recipient.</p>

                            <p>Bartlett worked for a company that owned a natural gas pipeline in Colorado. Part of his job was to aerially inspect the pipeline.

Bartlett's widow and three daughters filed a lawsuit against the aviation company, alleging that the pilot had no experience flying at high altitude or flying for pipeline inspections in mountainous terrain. The lawsuit was settled.</p>

                            <p>Sherman worked for a trucking company and was taking a sample from an open hatch atop an oil storage tank when he lost consciousness and fell backward. He was found dangling by his sweatshirt, which was caught on the tank's catwalk. The coroner initially ruled he died from heart disease, but, months later, his death became the earliest in Colorado to be linked to the inhalation of toxic fumes while conducting "tank gauging." Companies did not provide workers conducting tank gauging with respirators that could protect them from the fumes. Sherman was a native of Texas who enjoyed singing and playing the guitar. He was survived by four children and 10 grandchildren. In his obituary, his family thanked his employer, Now or Never Trucking, for its care and support.</p>
